## Project 1 Card Game
Lets build a deck of cards with the following functionality:
Create a new deck,
at application startup I'd like to tell you the number of players at the table 
grab x-position card within the deck, 
shuffle, 
list cards in order, 
list cards in reverse order,
deal hands of 5 cards each for number of players at table

You'll need:
Main application, 
models which could include: hand, deck, player, suits(enums?), table?
functions which might belong to a model class to complete above functionality

You'll likely want to research:
Enumerated values, 
data structures,
Math library,
Loops (for each, for i),
When and Switch statements,
elvis operator,
kotlin application arguments,
constructors and default constructors in kotlin,
kotlin companion objects
